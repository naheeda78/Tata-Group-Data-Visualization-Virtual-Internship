# Tata Group Data Visualization - Virtual Internship

Welcome to my Tata Data Visualization project, which was completed as part of the **Tata Group Virtual Internship** on Forage.  This **Data Visualization Virtual Internship** offered by Tata through Forage provides hands-on experience in leveraging data to create meaningful visual insights. By participating in this program, I had the opportunity to work on real-world data challenges faced by Tata Groupâ€™s businesses and enhance my skills in **data visualization** using **Power BI**.

The internship tasks were designed to simulate real-world business scenarios, requiring the use of data visualization techniques to solve complex problems and offer insights to business stakeholders.
